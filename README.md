## Process
   I started with doing some basic sketching which you can see below

   Once I had a low fidelity mock up and I did the basic css and html to have a basic website 
      - I got the logo and colors from the online PBS Brand guide
   From here I tackled the actual functionality piece by piece
      - The basic form component
      - CSS styling because the default looked horrendous
      - The actual exporting with CSV
    Various Testing happened in between
      - Mostly some Unit testing and Intregration done by hand

## What I'd add with more time
CSS Improvements
   - A little bit of weirdness happened with the centering and container overlap in the CSS stylings
   - With more time I'd hammer these out
   - It was mostly fine and it would have traded off with time spent on other places so I left it aloen 
API Implementation
   - In a real program I'd want an API adding this data to a database rather than having it in floating
   excels
   - I'd like to some automated basic analsys happening: min, max, averages trends
   - likely would have been done with SQUL & Python in an ideal world
Automatic data collection
- I feel like in a real life situation much of the info in this form could be collected automatically
- I imagine the sign-up date and last usage data could be pulled from a user who logged in assuming the related service
  tracked that info
- This is more ambitous than my prev suggestions but I think would be pratical and effective
